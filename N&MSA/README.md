Sentiment and Emotion Analysis of Reddit WallStreetBets Posts on GME Using NLP 

This academic project focuses on the application of NLP methods to analyze text-based data and the critical evaluation of both methods and results.

Project Objective: 

The objective was to perform a descriptive and NLP-based analysis of Reddit WallStreetBets posts, with a specific focus on GME, including frequent terms and daily average sentiment and emotion analysis, and to compare these patterns with GME stock price movements during January–February 2021. The strengths and limitations of the applied models were also critically discussed.

Approach:

- End-to-end work with data understanding, data cleaning, and filtering
- Application of NLP methods for analyzing unstructured text
- Critical evaluation of models and their outputs


Methods & Techniques:

- Descriptive statistics (posting volume, average post length)
- Word frequency analysis 
- Named Entity Recognition (spaCy)
- Sentiment analysis (BERT-based model)
- Zero-shot classification (BART-MNLI)


Key Learnings:

Data quality and text length have a significant impact on BERT model outputs.
A potential solution is to split long texts into smaller chunks and aggregate predictions at document leve, although this increases the amount of data processed and computational resource requirements or to apply models specifically designed for longer input sequences.

General-purpose language models have limitations when applied to domain-specific text
Model results must always be interpreted in the context of the data and domain

This project highlights my ability to work in a structured, end-to-end manner with NLP, understand model limitations, and translate analysis into meaningful insights.
